You can hook up here a nice cache system as well.\r\n\r\nSo how it works. First download the **class.mysql.php** file and add it to your **includes/ folder**. Now include it to your core-file of your system, or if you are not that far in your programming experience, then include it to the file, that needs mysql queries:\r\n\r\n    require ('class.mysql.php');\r\n\r\n**Configuring** it works two ways. Either you can have a config file somewhere, that is gonna get included before the class.mysql.php file and the config file, will have mysql config array like this in it:\r\n\r\n    $config_mysql = array(\r\n        // 'server' by default is localhost\r\n        'database' => 'database_1',\r\n        'user' => 'user_1',\r\n        'password' => 'password123',\r\n        'table_prefix' => 'kv_'\r\n    );\r\n\r\n**Or** you simply don't use the config array and set everything up inside the class.mysql.php\r\n\r\n**Now initializing the class:**\r\n\r\n**If you are using the config array:**\r\n\r\n    $DB = new DB($config_mysql);\r\n\r\n**Else:**\r\n\r\n    $DB = new DB;\r\n\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\nSimple query:\r\n\r\n    $DB->query(\"\");\r\n\r\nQuery first: \r\n\r\n    $DB->query_first(\"\");\r\n\r\nFetching:\r\n\r\n    $names = $DB->query(\"SELECT * {TABLE_PREFIX}names\");\r\n    \r\n    while ($name = $DB->fetch_array($names )) {\r\n    \r\n        echo $name['first] . ' ' . $name['last'];\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlso you can do query array:\r\n\r\n    $DB->(\"SELECT * FROM {TABLE_PREFIX}users WHERE id IN ({ARRAY})\", array(1, 4, 5, 7));\r\n\r\nArray will be imploded with comas then.\r\n\r\nBy Kalle H.
